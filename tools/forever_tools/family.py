"""The shared "My other Forever addons" block in every addon's README.md and docs/curseforge.md (WFA-32).

`BLOCK` is the one copy: a heading, a sentence and a table of the five addons in the family's order, each name linked
to its CurseForge page. Each repo places it once per file, between `START` and `END`, where it fits that page; `check`
fails when a file lacks the markers or the text between them differs, so a change here reaches every page through a
sync and nothing drifts.

    python3 tools/check_family.py          # check README.md and docs/curseforge.md
    python3 tools/check_family.py --fix    # rewrite the text between the markers (the markers stay where they are)
    python3 tools/check_family.py --print  # print the block, markers included, to place it the first time
